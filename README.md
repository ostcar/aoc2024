# Advent of Code 2024

Here are my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2024. This
year in [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/).

It uses an [aoc platform](https://github.com/ostcar/roc-aoc-platform).


## Run

To run a day, call:

```
roc dayXX.roc
```

or for an optimized build:

```
roc dayXX.roc --optimize 
```

Input files are expected next to the Roc-Script. For example, if your Roc file
is called `dayXX.roc`, it expects the input file to be `dayXX.input`.

Call a Roc-Script with `--help` to see options:

```
roc dayXX.roc -- --help
```
